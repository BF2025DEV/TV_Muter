# TV Muter Configuration File
# Edit these settings as needed

# Audio Recording Settings
audio:
  sample_rate: 16000  # Hz - lower rate saves space, sufficient for commercial detection
  channels: 1  # Mono audio
  chunk_size: 1024  # Samples per buffer
  device_index: null  # null = use default, or specify device number (find with step 1 script)

# Feature Extraction Settings
features:
  window_size: 1.0  # seconds - analyze audio in 1-second windows
  hop_size: 0.5  # seconds - overlap between windows

  # Which features to extract
  extract_rms: true  # Root Mean Square (loudness)
  extract_zcr: true  # Zero Crossing Rate (pitch)
  extract_spectral_centroid: true  # Brightness of sound
  extract_spectral_rolloff: true  # Shape of spectrum
  extract_mfcc: true  # Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (voice characteristics)
  n_mfcc: 13  # Number of MFCC coefficients

# Model Training Settings
model:
  sequence_length: 10  # seconds - how much history to consider
  train_split: 0.8  # 80% training, 20% validation
  epochs: 50  # Training iterations
  batch_size: 32
  learning_rate: 0.001

# Commercial Detection Settings
detection:
  confidence_threshold: 0.7  # 0-1, higher = more conservative (fewer false positives)
  min_commercial_duration: 15  # seconds - ignore detections shorter than this
  min_program_duration: 30  # seconds - ignore program segments shorter than this
  debounce_time: 2.0  # seconds - wait this long before changing state

# TV Control Settings (for later - Pi deployment)
tv_control:
  method: "cec"  # Options: "cec", "ir", or "none"
  test_mode: true  # If true, print actions instead of executing them

# Data Collection Settings
data_collection:
  save_raw_audio: true  # Keep original audio files
  auto_save_interval: 60  # seconds - auto-save labels this often

# File Paths (relative to project root)
paths:
  raw_data: "data/raw"
  labels: "data/labels"
  processed_data: "data/processed"
  models: "models"
  music: "music"
